### Hi there, I'm Tamas 👋

📐 Well-organized, egoless and aspiring web-developer, avid coder and technology lover with an ambition to learn. I mostly specialize in full-stack web development with a stronger liking for the front-end part. 

🔨 I'm currently working at Edge as a full-time platform engineer. Additionally, I am a crypto/nft investor/researcher, part-time streamer on Twitch 📺 and I also spend some time editing videos for my youtube channel.

🌠 Plans for the next year: 
- Looking to get into blockchain development/web3 (defi, mining but mostly metaverse/gaming)
- Learn some DevOpzzz and get a more in-depth understanding of Amazon Web Services
{/* - Update my old portfolio website and find clients as a freelancer web developer /while keeping my full-time job/ */} - would love to but really don't have the time currently
