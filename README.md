### Hi there, I'm Tamas 👋

📐 Well-organized, egoless and aspiring web-developer, avid coder and technology lover with an ambition to learn. I mostly specialize in full-stack web development with a stronger liking for the front-end part. 

🔨 I'm currently working at Edge as a full-time platform engineer. Additionally, I am a part-time streamer on Twitch 📺 and I also spend a big chunk of my freetime editing videos for my youtube channel.

🌠 Plans for the next year: 
- Looking to get into AI/ML and start learning python
- Learn some DevOpzzz and get a more in-depth understanding of the different web services (and their configs) offered by Amazon
- Update my old portfolio website and find clients as a freelancer web developer /while keeping my full-time job/
